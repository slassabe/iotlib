"Less is More - Powering Your IoT Solutions with MQTT integration"

## Description

**iotlib** is a versatile python library built upon PahoTM MQTT, designed to simplify IoT application development without the overpromises of no-code platforms.

![Alt text](doc/src/_images/landscape.png)


Key features includes:

- Offers a **programmatic alternative** to traditional home automation platforms such as openHAB, Home Assistant, and Jeedom, providing more flexibility and control.
- A robust communication bridge leveraging the **MQTT protocol**, ensuring reliable data transfer between devices.
- Designed with a **protocol-agnostic** approach, our system supports both direct device integration over MQTT (such as Shelly or Tasmota devices) and gateway integration (via platforms like Zigbee2MQTT, ring to MQTT or miflora to MQTT) . This offers enhanced flexibility in integrating various devices.
- Comprehensive support for the creation and management of **virtual devices**, simplifying the integration between devices models, providers et protocols.
- Implementation of the **Observer design pattern**, enabling automatic triggering of actions on switches based on sensor value changes.
